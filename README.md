## Avion Banking App

### Scenario

- The user is a bank employee who manually manages the bank's accounts.
- He does the creation of account manually using the account holders name and sets the initial balance of the account if possible.
- He also does the withdrawal and deposit manually for each account.
- He also does the transfer of balances if there are requests for it.
- Your task is to help this poor employee out by creating a simple admin banking app.
- PS: Don't worry about security for now, he is a trustworthy guy... I think... ðŸ˜…



### Features

- app should have a page to display all users (can be a table where the name and balance are visible)
- app should have a page for creating a user using email and password
- app should have a page for deposit/withdraw/transfer (can be separate or in one page)
- all design features will depend on YOUR IDEAS.



### Error Handling

- wrong_arguments (e.g. amount cannot be negative, name cannot start with a number)
- user_already_exists ('Den' == 'den')
- user_does_not_exists ('Den' == 'den')
- not_enough_money
- sender_does_not_exists
- receiver_does_not_exists



### Use localStorage

- You may use a button somewhere in your application page that when pressed should load the initial data to the localStorage
- This will help you, and other visitors on you Github Page, to immediately test the capabilities of your banking app

**Note**: localStorage across different pages will only work on your Github Pages because it depends on the domain.



### Something Unique

- Create at least 3 features unique to your banking app
- The feature should make it convenient for the user to use your app.
- It can be a graph of some sort?
- It can be a totally new page that does another thing?
- Or just surprise us... ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
